/*
subscription table schema: id, subsciption_start, subscription_end
In the examples, the company has a minimum subscription duration of one month.
This means that the subscription_start always falls before the beginning of the month that contains their subscription_end. 
This is not always the case in real world, and you may need to account for customers canceling within the same month that they subscribe.
